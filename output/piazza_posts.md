# @1 Welcome to Piazza!
- Question: Piazza is a Q&amp;A platform designed to get you great answers from classmates and instructors fast. We've 
put together this list of tips you might find handy as you get started:  Ask questions!The best way to get answers is to
 ask questions! Ask questions on Piazza rather than emailing your teaching staff so everyone can benefit from the 
response (and so you can get answers from classmates who are up as late as you are).Edit questions and answers wiki-
style.Think of Piazza as a Q&amp;A wiki for your class. Every question has just a single students' answer that students 
can edit collectively (and a single instructors’ answer for instructors). Add a followup to comment or ask further 
questions.To comment on or ask further questions about a post, start a followup discussion. Mark it resolved when the 
issue has been addressed, and add any relevant information back into the Q&amp;A above. Go anonymous.Shy? No problem. 
You can always opt to post or edit anonymously. Tag your posts.It's far more convenient to find all posts about your 
Homework 3 or Midterm 1 when the posts are tagged. Type a “#” before a key word to tag. Click a blue tag in a post or 
the question feed to filter for all posts that share that tag. Format code and equations.Adding a code snippet? Click 
the pre or tt button in the question editor to add pre-formatted or inline teletype text. Mathematical equation? Click 
the Fx button to access the LaTeX editor to build a nicely formatted equation. View and download class details and 
resources.  Click the Course Page button in your top bar to access the class syllabus, staff contact information, office
 hours details, and course resources—all in one place!Contact the Piazza Team anytime with questions or comments at 
team@piazza.com. We love feedback!
